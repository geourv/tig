# unaltraweb Consumer Contract

## Repository Role

This repository is a thin `unaltremanual` consumer of `unaltraweb`.

- Default language: `ca`.
- Maintained languages: `ca`.
- Site-specific configuration belongs in `_config.yml`.
- Reader-facing content and project assets belong in this repository.
- Reusable layouts, includes, plugins, Sass, JavaScript, build orchestration, and MCP behavior belong in the `unaltraweb` core.

Do not copy core runtime files into this site to customize behavior. Propose reusable changes in the core and keep this consumer limited to explicit configuration and content.

Read `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` before creating a branch or editing files. It is the package-managed contract for task naming, reservations, single-checkout session coordination, figures, provider integrations, and cleanup.

## Working Workflow

1. Before editing locally, run the MCP control plane's read-only checkout preflight in the primary mutable checkout. Keep one active editing session per repository and use its `exec` wrapper when a process-held cooperative lease is required.
2. For MCP-backed work, request one top-level MCP and let the control plane select its declared dependency closure. The consumer root must be passed through `MCP_CONSUMER_WORKSPACE`.
3. Never create, switch to, move, prune, repair, or remove linked worktrees as part of an editing session.
4. Inspect `site_context`, `site_doctor`, the language policy, and the active profile before editing.
5. For `unaltremanual`, inspect `manual_authoring_capabilities` and `context/writing-profile.md` before drafting chapters.
6. Edit executable computation, capture, diagram, or visualization sources rather than generated outputs.
7. Run `site_check` before `build_site`, then review the labelled local preview.
8. Keep default-language content in `draft` or `review` until the author approves it; translate only approved sources.
9. Do not commit visible content or publish artefacts until the human author has reviewed the rendered result and explicitly approved it.

Normal local commands are `make build`, `make serve`, `make test`, and `make down`. They must not publish or change Git history.
