abstract = {Introducci{\'{o}}n Tanto la normativa sobre calidad que se ha ido generando recientemente en las universidades espa{\~{n}}olas como el proceso de convergencia de cara a un Espacio Europeo de Educaci{\'{o}}n Superior nos colocan ante el reto de reforzar la planificaci{\'{o}}n de la docencia mediante gu{\'{i}}as did{\'{a}}cticas que faciliten el aprendizaje de nuestros estudiantes. Entre esas recomendaciones de las universidades aparece reiteradamente la necesidad de reforzar la planificaci{\'{o}}n de la oferta formativa que ofrece cada Facultad o Escuela desde las titulaciones hasta las materias. Cabr{\'{i}}a entender, en ese sentido, que una buena planificaci{\'{o}}n de la formaci{\'{o}}n constituye una pieza b{\'{a}}sica en la configuraci{\'{o}}n de una docencia de calidad. Es por eso que, para facilitar la elaboraci{\'{o}}n de buenos programas por parte de los profesores, se recomienda que las universidades, a trav{\'{e}}s de los equipos t{\'{e}}cnicos que establezcan al efecto, faciliten gu{\'{i}}as, ofrezcan orientaciones y presten ayuda especializada sobre todo el proceso de planificaci{\'{o}}n y desarrollo de la docencia. La programaci{\'{o}}n de la docencia juega, desde luego, un importante papel en el desarrollo de una docencia de calidad. Dar coherencia a las titulaciones, coordinar los programas de las diversas materias, enriquecer informativamente los programas de forma que dejen claro el sentido del trabajo a desarrollar, homogeneizarlos para facilitar su lectura y el contraste con otros programas por parte de nuestros alumnos y tambi{\'{e}}n de los alumnos Erasmus, ponerlos en la red a disposici{\'{o}}n de los interesados, etc. Constituyen operaciones de planificaci{\'{o}}n docente que necesariamente debemos realizar los profesores como parte de nuestra actuaci{\'{o}}n docente. Tambi{\'{e}}n el proceso de convergencia europea en el que est{\'{a}}n inmersas nuestras universidades plantea como unos de sus objetivos optimizar los procesos de planificaci{\'{o}}n docente de forma que se facilite la visibilidad y comparabilidad de los programas. Algunos de los principios y recomendaciones de la convergencia tienen que ver, directa o indirectamente, con las gu{\'{i}}as did{\'{a}}cticas. El enfoque pedag{\'{o}}gico del proceso de convergencia est{\'{a}} basado en un principio b{\'{a}}sico: " The shift from teaching to learning, from input to output, and to the processes and the contexts of learner " . Esto es, se pretende una transformaci{\'{o}}n de la docencia universitaria en la que el eje fundamental no sea la ense{\~{n}}anza sino el aprendizaje. De cara a la planificaci{\'{o}}n did{\'{a}}ctica de nuestras clases eso significa, entre otras cosas, lo siguiente:},

    note = "This book presents a new type of modeling environment where users interact with geospatial simulations using 3D physical models of studied landscapes. Multiple users can alter the physical model by hand during scanning, thereby providing input for simulation of geophysical processes in this setting. The authors have developed innovative techniques and software that couple this hardware with open source GRASS GIS, making the system instantly applicable to a wide range of modeling and design problems. Since no other literature on this topic is available, this Book fills a gap for this new technology that continues to grow. Tangible Modeling with Open Source GIS will appeal to advanced-level students studying geospatial science, computer science and earth science such as landscape architecture and natural resources. It will also benefit researchers and professionals working in geospatial modeling applications, computer graphics, hazard risk management, hydrology, solar energy, coastal and fluvial flooding, fire spread, landscape, park design and computer games.

GIS is used today to better understand and solve urban problems. ***GIS in Sustainable Urban Planning and Management: A Global Perspective*** , explores and illustrates the capacity that geo-information and GIS have to inform practitioners and other participants in the processes of the planning and management of urban regions. The first part of the book addresses the concept of sustainable urban development, its different frameworks, the many ways of measuring sustainability, and its value in the urban policy arena. The second part discusses how urban planning can shape our cities, examines various spatial configurations of cities, the spread of activities, and the demands placed on different functions to achieve strategic objective. It further focuses on the recognition that urban dwellers are increasingly under threat from natural hazards and climate change.
Written by authors with expertise on the applications of geo-information in urban management, this book showcases the importance of GIS in better understanding current urban challenges and provides new insights on how to apply GIS in urban planning. It illustrates through real world cases the use of GIS in analyzing and evaluating the position of disadvantaged groups and areas in cities and provides clear examples of applied GIS in urban sustainability and urban resilience. 
The idea of sustainable development is still very much central in the new development agenda of the United Nations, and in that sense, it is of particular importance for students from both the Global South and Global North.

    note = "*GIS Tutorial for Crime Analysis, second edition* , is a workbook for crime analysts and students of criminology. The book presents state-of-the-art methods that can be incorporated into any police department’s standard practices. This second edition builds upon the first edition by updating tutorials, adding a new chapter on building and evaluating predictive models using ModelBuilder and ArcGIS’s hot spot analysis tools, and adding a capstone project on hot spot modeling.
In contrast to GIS workbooks that teach skills for one-time projects, this book has users build and use a crime mapping and analysis system to meet all spatial information needs of a police department. The book combines introductions to GIS and crime analysis methods and step-by-step tutorial exercises with independent assignments to teach key GIS skills, including data preparation and updating, map template building, map queries and analysis, automation of map production, and predictive modeling skills. The book also includes a 180-day trial version of ArcGIS Desktop software and tutorial data. Instructor resources are available upon request.

It describes the strategic planning process an organization must undertake prior to GIS implementation. The heart of the book is the formula for success that offers a systematic methodology for examining and benchmarking a GIS initiative and the practical and repeatable strategy for success.
There are many obstacles to successful GIS implementation, and unfortunately, the local government landscape is riddled with false starts, poorly planned implementations, and glorified mapping systems. This book documents the reason for failure and possible remedies to overcome the challenges to implementation. It discusses pathways to change, ways of improving organizational effectiveness and efficiency, and lays out the organizational approaches, management processes, and leadership actions that are required for GIS to become an indispensable part of an organization. This book is about aiming high, so you can consistently hit your mark by formulating goals and objectives that will tremendously influence the success of a GIS initiative. It details the factors crucial for building an enterprise GIS vision statement that includes governance, data and databases, procedures and workflow, GIS software, GIS training and education, and infrastructure, and how to develop performance measures related to the stated objectives of an organization. The book combines theory with real-world experience to offer guidance on the process of managing GIS implementation. Through key components, this book introduces a new way to think about GIS technology.

The focus is on the design, creation, development and operation of integrated Web-based GIS applications for weather, marine and atmospheric environments, and the Earth's magnetic field. More specifically, the aim of this book is to present characteristic applications of GIS to environmental monitoring including GIS solutions for eco-mapping sea and port-related parameters, climate changes, and geomagnetic field. 
In the first part of the book, the description of every application includes the user requirements, the design and development stages performed and the presentation of the final outcome, its capabilities and services. The Web-based applications are developed through different innovative approaches, such as cloud GIS and Google Apps for GIS, justifying the merit of WebGIS in the world of the environmental applications. The second part of the book provides an overview of geomagnetic field parameters and reveals the potential of using GIS for modeling and analyzing of the Earth's magnetic (geomagnetic) field and its parameters. Here, the authors present the recently introduced phenomenon called “geomagnetic pseudostorm”, which is modeled and further analyzed here with GIS technology and tools. 
This book appeals to those interested in various areas where spatial information becomes of paramount relevance (e.g. social and economic research and mapping, environmental and climate research, decision support systems, public services, and especially for geomagnetic field variations and for the design of warning systems for natural disasters). It presents modern methods and approaches to visualize and analyze spatial information using innovative techniques, procedures, and tools of WebGIS technology. In this book, the readers find a valuable companion in their efforts to design and develop their own WebGIS applications, as it includes useful examples of developing (Web)GIS applications regarding the monitoring of marine and atmospheric environments, as well as applications that deal with meteorological issues and the Earth’s magnetic field along with solar activity (space weather information).This book can also serve as a useful reference source for graduates, researchers and professionals related to the areas indicated above.

    note = "Coordinates are the foundation of GIS, cartography, and surveying, to name just a few fields. Computers have an astounding capacity for repetition and they possess a superior ability to handle the mathematics behind coordinate manipulation―but they are very bad at interpreting coordinates and coordinate systems. 
**Basic GIS Coordinates, Second Edition** clearly illustrates the basic principles of coordinate systems, covering ellipsoids, datums, and plane coordinates as they are used in GIS and GPS. Keeping in mind that it is ultimately incumbent on humans to ensure the correct use of coordinate systems, this book explains complex topics in a logical progression, presenting them in a way that is neither too complicated nor oversimplified. This new edition of a bestseller expands the material with updates on what has occurred in the field during the past five years, especially in the World Geodetic System and International Terrestrial Reference Frame. It also addresses the upcoming GNSS constellations and coordinate implications.
  * Details how to build a coordinate system
  * Addresses different methods of leveling, as well as measuring and modeling of height and gravity
  * Explores two-coordinate (state-plane, UTM) systems
  * Discusses initial points and other aspects of the rectangular system
  * Covers the geoid and the concepts of elevation


There are thousands of horizontal geodetic datums and Cartesian coordinate systems currently sanctioned by governments around the world to describe our planet electronically and on paper. Even if a computer has done nothing wrong, coordinate errors can often occur and lead to potentially disastrous miscalculations. This book is a valuable tool to help readers develop an understanding of how coordinate systems work―and how they sometimes don’t.

    note = "New data acquisition techniques are emerging and are providing fast and efficient means for multidimensional spatial data collection. Airborne LIDAR surveys, SAR satellites, stereo-photogrammetry and mobile mapping systems are increasingly used for the digital reconstruction of the environment. All these systems provide extremely high volumes of raw data, often enriched with other sensor data (e.g., beam intensity). Improving methods to process and visually analyze this massive amount of geospatial and user-generated data is crucial to increase the efficiency of organizations and to better manage societal challenges. 
Within this context, this book proposes an up-to-date view of computational methods and tools for spatio-temporal data fusion, multivariate surface generation, and feature extraction, along with their main applications for surface approximation and rainfall analysis. The book is intended to attract interest from different fields, such as computer vision, computer graphics, geomatics, and remote sensing, working on the common goal of processing 3D data. To this end, it presents and compares methods that process and analyze the massive amount of geospatial data in order to support better management of societal challenges through more timely and better decision making, independent of a specific data modeling paradigm (e.g., 2D vector data, regular grids or 3D point clouds). 
We also show how current research is developing from the traditional layered approach, adopted by most GIS softwares, to intelligent methods for integrating existing data sets that might contain important information on a geographical area and environmental phenomenon. These services combine traditional map-oriented visualization with fully 3D visual decision support methods and exploit semantics-oriented information (e.g., a-priori knowledge, annotations, segmentations) when processing, merging, and integrating big pre-existing data sets.

The book introduces basic theoretical material from a social science perspective and discusses how data are handled in GIS, what the standard commands within GIS packages are, and what they can offer in terms of spatial analysis. It covers the range of applications for which GIS has been primarily used in the social sciences, offering a global perspective of examples at a range of spatial scales. The book explores the use of GIS in crime, health, education, retail location, urban planning, transport, geodemographics, emergency planning and poverty/income inequalities. It is supplemented with practical activities and datasets that are linked to the content of each chapter and provided on an eResource page. The examples are written using ArcMap to show how the user can access data and put the theory in the textbook to applied use using proprietary GIS software. 
This book serves as a useful guide to a social science approach to GIS techniques and applications. It provides a range of modern applications of GIS with associated practicals to work through, and demonstrates how researcher and policy makers alike can use GIS to plan services more effectively. It will prove to be of great interest to geographers, as well as the broader social sciences, such as sociology, crime science, health, business and marketing.

  * This easy-to-follow guide allows you to manage and analyze geographic data with ease using open source tools
  * Publish your geographical data online
  * Learn the basics of geoinformatics in a practical way by solving problems


\#\#\#\# Book Description
The most commonly used GIS tools automate tasks that were historically done manually—compiling new maps by overlaying one on top of the other or physically cutting maps into pieces representing specific study areas, changing their projection, and getting meaningful results from the various layers by applying mathematical functions and operations. This book is an easy-to-follow guide to use the most matured open source GIS tools for these tasks.
We'll start by setting up the environment for the tools we use in the book. Then you will learn how to work with QGIS in order to generate useful spatial data. You will get to know the basics of queries, data management, and geoprocessing.
After that, you will start to practice your knowledge on real-world examples. We will solve various types of geospatial analyses with various methods. We will start with basic GIS problems by imitating the work of an enthusiastic real estate agent, and continue with more advanced, but typical tasks by solving a decision problem.
Finally, you will find out how to publish your data (and results) on the web. We will publish our data with QGIS Server and GeoServer, and create a basic web map with the API of the lightweight Leaflet web mapping library.
\#\#\#\# What you will learn
  * Collect GIS data for your needs
  * Store the data in a PostGIS database
  * Exploit the data using the power of the GIS queries
  * Analyze the data with basic and more advanced GIS tools
  * Publish your data and share it with others
  * Build a web map with your published data

    note = "*Mapping Space, Sense, and Movement in Florence* explores the potential of digital mapping or Historical GIS as a research and teaching tool to enable researchers and students to uncover the spatial, kinetic and sensory dimensions of the early modern city. 
The exploration focuses on new digital research and mapping projects that engage the rich social, cultural, and artistic life of Florence in particular. One is a new GIS tool known as DECIMA, (Digitally-Encoded Census Information and Mapping Archive), and the other is a smartphone app called Hidden Florence. The international collaborators who have helped build these and other projects address three questions: how such projects can be created when there are typically fewer sources than for modern cities; how they facilitate more collaborative models for historical research into social relations, senses, and emotions; and how they help us interrogate older historical interpretations and create new models of analysis and communication. Four authors examine technical issues around the software programs and manuscripts. Five then describe how GIS can be used to advance and develop existing research projects. Finally, four authors look to the future and consider how digital mapping transforms the communication of research results, and makes it possible to envision new directions in research. 
This exciting new volume is illustrated throughout with maps, screenshots and diagrams to show the projects at work. It will be essential reading for students and scholars of early modern Italy, the Renaissance and digital humanities.

Continued technological advances and decreased costs have altered the GPS vendor landscape significantly and opened the door to an array of receiver and software options. 
Retaining the in-depth description that made the previous edition so popular, **The Global Positioning System and ArcGIS, Third Edition** has expanded its coverage to review the capabilities and features common to most receivers. While it emphasizes Trimble and Magellan hardware and Trimble TerraSync and ESRI ArcPad software to capture data, the text’s broadened coverage makes it useful with virtually any hardware/software packages, so readers will be able to collect GPS data and install it in ArcGIS―regardless of the data capture mechanism.
Covering the latest developments in this emerging field, the third edition has been updated to include: 
  * New information on automated data collection
  * Updates to the conversion of GPS data into GIS form with ArcGIS Desktop (v. 9.3) as well as ESRI software
  * An examination of differential correction and improvements in accuracy of collected data 
  * Additional emphasis on ArcMap and Pathfinder Office
  * Illustrations using ArcMap to combine GPS data with other data sets including raster DRGs, DOQs, DEMs, and various vector data sets 


Using a top-down approach, each chapter begins with a theoretical overview followed by self-study exercises and projects that provide step-by-step guidance on applying the concepts using GPS hardware or a PC. The text includes a CD-ROM with GPS data sets for exercises in Trimble SSF and ESRI shapefile formats, plus other valuable learning resources.

    note = "Geospatial technologies in general – and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in particular – are becoming increasingly important in our society. GIS technology is used to identify the optimal routes for emergency vehicles, to determine the best locations for various businesses, schools, and facilities, to monitor the growth and expansion of urban areas as a way to manage natural resources, and much more. 
  * **Principles of Geographic Information Systems** *by John Jensen and Ryan Jensen is an ideal introduction for those who know very little about geographic information systems and spatial analysis. Relatively complex GIS principles are introduced in basic terms, often using graphics to communicate principles rather than complex mathematical equations. Content is not geared toward any single commercial GIS software program, and the book’s timely, practical examples and extensive visual format appeal to today’s students. This text can be used at the undergraduate or graduate level in one or two semester courses in Introductory and Intermediate GIS, yet can also be useful for professionals looking to increase their knowledge in this subject area.

The second part concerns issues related to spatial and cartographical representations of the geographical world. The third part is focused on the ontology of geography, specifically in terms of geographical entities, objects and boundaries. Finally, in the fourth part, the topic of GIS constitutes a starting point for exploring themes such as quantum geography and disorientation, and for defining professional profiles for geographers with competences in GIS environment. This book on a new and unexplored field of research could be a fundamental point of reference for professional philosophers and geographers interested in the theoretical reflection about the foundational concepts of GIScience.

* Where's the most and least?
* How much is where?
* What's inside?
* What's nearby?
* What's changed?
But how do you get started? The second edition of  *The Esri Guide to GIS Analysis,* Volume 1 shows you how and more.

However, there are currently no textbooks on this rapidly changing field, and methods tend to be shared informally. Addressing this gap in the literature, the respective chapters outline many topics pertaining to cartography and mapping such as the role and definition of planetary cartography and (vs?) Geographic Information Science; theoretical background and practical methodologies in geological mapping; science-ready versus public-ready products; a goal/procedure-focused practical manual of the most commonly used software in planetary mapping, which includes generic (ArcGIS and its extensions, JMARS) and specific tools (HiView, Cratertools etc.); extracting topographic information from images; thematic mapping: climate; geophysics; surface modeling; change detection; landing site selection; shared maps; dynamic maps on the web; planetary GIS interfaces; crowdsourcing; crater counting techniques; irregular bodies; geological unit symbology; mapping center activities; and web services. All chapters were prepared by authors who have actually produced geological maps or GISs for NASA / the USGS, DLR, ESA or MIIGAIK. Taken together, they offer an excellent resource for all planetary scientists whose research depends on mapping, and for students of astrogeology.
