# GitHub Web Editing Workflow

This site uses the **`unaltremanual`** profile: Book-like manual, course, or teaching site.

The package-managed collaboration contract is `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`. It defines branch names, exact path reservations, local worktree isolation, generated figure bundles, and provider integrations.

GitHub Web is suitable for small, coordinated content updates. Follow this workflow before changing a file:

1. Open or choose an issue that describes one focused task.
2. Be assigned to the issue, or add an explicit reservation naming the files you will edit and wait for the maintainer to accept it. There must be only one active editor per file.
3. Create one correctly named branch per task as defined in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`. Use GitHub's branch selector or choose **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. Never edit or commit directly to `main`.
4. Open a Draft pull request early, link the issue, and list the reserved files so other editors can avoid them.
5. Change only the reserved content and keep the pull request small. Use another issue and branch for unrelated work.
6. Review the **Files changed** tab before requesting review. Do not include technical files, generated outputs, or unrelated formatting.
7. If GitHub reports a conflict, stop editing. Do not guess at a resolution or overwrite another editor's work; ask the maintainer to coordinate it.
8. Leave the pull request in Draft until the content and file list are ready. The maintainer runs local checks and required renders before merging, then starts deployment manually only when publication is intended.

## The Four Profiles

| Profile | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `unaltreselfie` | A personal academic or professional site |
| `unaltreprojecte` | A research project, group, infrastructure, or output site |
| `unaltremanual` | A book-like manual, course, or teaching site |
| `unaltredocs` | A technical or operational documentation portal |

The selected profile is `unaltremanual`. Do not change the profile as part of an ordinary content edit.

## Editable Content For `unaltremanual`

- `_pages/<lang>/`: localized manual home pages
- `_chapters/<lang>/`: hand-written chapters and authoritative executable chapter sources
- `_bibliography/`: verified manual references
- `context/writing-profile.md`: audience, voice, terminology, evidence, and review rules
- `assets/img/`: approved source images that are not renderer-generated

With maintainer approval, `_config.yml` may receive a small change to public site text, languages, URLs, or profile options. Ask before changing its structure.

## Local Maintainer Workflow

For rendered review, run the generated Docker-backed targets from this repository:

```bash
make build
make serve
make test
make down
```

These commands validate, build, preview, test, and stop the site. They do not publish it or change Git history.

## MCP Agent Workflow

Open this repository as the IDE workspace and read `AGENTS.md`. Use the `unaltraweb` MCP to inspect `site_context` and `site_doctor`, run `site_check` before `build_site`, and review the labelled local preview. Keep durable decisions in versioned files rather than chat history. If the selected MCP image is not available, ask the core maintainer for the published release or for the reviewed candidate build; do not replace its pin with a mutable tag.

## Upload Images Safely

1. Reserve the destination filename with the rest of the task and upload on the task branch, never on `main`.
2. Use a descriptive lowercase filename in `assets/img/` or an existing editorial image subfolder. Do not upload into `assets/img/generated/`.
3. Prefer a reasonably sized PNG, JPEG, or WebP. Only upload SVG files from a reviewed, trusted source.
4. Confirm that the image may be published and contains no confidential information, unintended personal data, or sensitive metadata.
5. Use a new filename instead of replacing an existing image unless the replacement is explicitly reserved. Add meaningful alternative text where the image is referenced.
6. Include the image and its content reference in the same small pull request, then ask the maintainer to inspect the rendered page.

## Never Edit These Paths In GitHub Web

- `.github/`, `.unaltraweb/`, `.gitignore`, `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, and `Makefile` are repository and runtime controls.
- `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `_plugins/`, and `_sass/` are technical theme overrides.
- `_site/`, `tmp/`, `.jekyll-cache/`, `.bundle/`, and `vendor/` are local build products or caches.
- `assets/img/generated/`, `.unaltraweb/computations.lock.json`, `.vegavisuals.lock.json`, rendered diagram/capture outputs, and other files marked as generated must be recreated by their renderer.
- When a `.qmd`, `.Rmd`, `.R`, `.py`, or `.ipynb` source owns a Markdown result, edit the source locally; never edit its generated `.md` in GitHub Web.
Never add passwords, access tokens, API keys, private keys, credentials, or `.env` files to an issue, branch, commit, or pull request. Ask the maintainer when a requested change falls outside the editable paths above.

## unaltremanual Publishing Channels

- `latest` is a manual-only deployment built from the reviewed `main` branch.
- Pushing or merging to `main` does not publish the manual. A maintainer starts the deployment manually after local checks, required renders, and human review.
- When PDF output is enabled, the default PDF and cover outputs, `assets/pdf/manual-<lang>.pdf` and `assets/img/manual-cover-<lang>.png`, are generated for deployment and are not versioned. Do not upload, edit, or commit them.
- The generated manual home, `manual-release.json`, and PDF editorial credits identify the publication channel and selector. Use the same selector for PDF build, site build, and local candidate checks.
- Stable editions use `vYYYY.MM(.N)`: `vYYYY.MM` for the first edition in a month and `vYYYY.MM.N` for an additional edition. They are deferred to explicit releases, and a `latest` deployment never creates one.
- Prepare a stable candidate only from the exact clean reviewed commit and an `unaltraweb-mcp` image selected by immutable digest; the candidate records both identities.
- Release checks reject `legacy/` or `sandbox/` content in the generated site. Keep those trees outside current manual content paths.

## Maintainer-Only Local Review And Deployment

Content editors stop after requesting pull request review. A maintainer then:

1. Checks out the task branch locally and confirms that it contains only the reserved files.
2. Runs the site's local checks and every required computation, diagram, visualization, capture, and PDF render. At minimum, the generated site supports `make test` for its normal site build and HTML audit.
3. Reviews the rendered pages and, for manuals, the generated PDF and cover.
4. Resolves coordination questions, approves the pull request, and merges it into `main`.
5. Starts the deploy workflow manually from GitHub Actions only after the reviewed change is on `main` and should go live.

Repository administrators must enforce this workflow with a `main` branch ruleset that blocks direct changes and requires pull-request approval; this document is not an access control. Stable manual publication additionally requires immutable releases, protected `v*` tags, and approved reviewers on the `stable-release` environment.

Pushing a branch or merging it does not publish this site. Local build and render commands also do not deploy it.
